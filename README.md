Welcome to Cow and Bull game!!

Do 'pip install pyEnchant'

Description of the game!
    
    If a person thinks 5 letter word in mind, the other guy has to guess it within 10 attempts to win the game. 
    
    Computer thinks and stores the word, and we have to guess it in 10 chances.
    
    Suppose the word the computer thinks is "PRICE" and we guess "peace", then we get 3 BULLS (which is 'P','C','E') and 0 COWS. 
    
    Bull means, the letter is in the main word matching the exact position.
    
    If the word guessed is "story", then we get 1 cow (which is 'r') because 'r' is in the main word but not in the exact position.
    
    
    Example!
    Computer thinks the word "Train". 
    Our guess number 1 - "Likes" . ------we get 1 cow (which is 'i')
    our guess number 2 - "Story" . ------We get 2 cows (which is 't' and 'r')
    our guess number 3 - "Trend" . ------We get 2 Bulls (which is 't' and 'r') and 1 cow (which is 'n')
    
    If we guess 'Train' with in 10th chance, then we get all the bulls and we win the game.
